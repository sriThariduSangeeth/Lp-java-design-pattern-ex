<p>Welcome to the Memento Design Pattern in Java tutorial. <strong> Memento design pattern </strong> is one of the behavioral design pattern. 
Memento design pattern is used when we want to save the state of an object so that we can restore later on. Memento pattern is used to implement 
this in such a way that the saved state data of the object is not accessible outside of the object, this protects the integrity of saved state data.</p>

<p>One of the best real life example is the text editors where we can save itâ€™s data anytime and use undo to restore it to previous saved state.</p>
