<p>Welcome to the Factory Design Pattern in Java tutorial. <strong>Factory Pattern</strong> is one of the <strong>Creational Design pattern</strong> and it’s widely used in JDK as well as frameworks like Spring and Struts.</p>
<p>The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the client program to the factory class.</p>
<p>Let’s first learn how to implement a factory design pattern in java and then we will look into factory pattern advantages.Note that this pattern is also known as <strong>Factory Method Design Pattern</strong>.</p>

<h3><span id="factory-design-pattern-advantages">:a:&ensp;&ensp; Factory Design Pattern Advantages</span></h3>
<ol><li>Factory design pattern provides approach to code for interface rather than implementation.</li><li>Factory pattern removes the instantiation of actual implementation classes from client code. Factory pattern makes our code more robust, less coupled and easy to extend. For example, we can easily change PC class implementation because client program is unaware of this.</li><li>Factory pattern provides abstraction between implementation and client classes through inheritance.</li></ol>
